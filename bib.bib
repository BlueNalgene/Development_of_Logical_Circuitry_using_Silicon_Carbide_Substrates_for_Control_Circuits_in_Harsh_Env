  abstract = {Silicon carbide (SiC), a material long known with potential for high-temperature, high-power, high-frequency, and radiation hardened applications, has emerged as the most mature of the wide-bandgap (2.0 eV $\lessequivlnt$ Eg $\lessequivlnt$ 7.0 eV) semiconductors since the release of commercial 6H-SiC bulk substrates in 1991 and 4H-SiC substrates in 1994. Following a brief introduction to SiC material properties, the status of SiC in terms of bulk crystal growth, unit device fabrication processes, device performance, circuits and sensors is discussed. Emphasis is placed upon demonstrated high-temperature applications, such as power transistors and rectifiers, turbine engine combustion monitoring, temperature sensors, analog and digital circuitry, flame detectors, and accelerometers. While individual device performances have been impressive (e.g. 4H-SiC MESFETs with fmax of 42 GHz and over 2.8 W mm-1 power density; 4H-SiC static induction transistors with 225 W power output at 600 MHz, 47\% power added efficiency (PAE), and 200 V forward blocking voltage), material defects in SiC, in particular micropipe defects, remain the primary impediment to wide-spread application in commercial markets. Micropipe defect densities have been reduced from near the 1000 cm-2 order of magnitude in 1992 to 3.5 cm-2 at the research level in 1995.},

  abstract = {The high temperature applications of SiC based devices have been considered for a long time. On the other hand, the recent progress in the epitaxial and bulk growth of silicon carbide have made possible the realization of a large variety of devices intended for specific applications. However, the full achievement of high temperature capabilities of SiC will not be only determined by the development of the material itself (purification, structural perfectness etc.) but also by the development of related device elements such as ohmic contacts, insulating layers, interconnections, encapsulation techniques, etc. This paper reviews two groups of problems which play a key role in the development of a SiC based high temperature electronics: (1) physical problems of the real high temperature properties of SiC, (2) physical and technical problems of the high temperature related electrical parts.},

The logic inverter is truly the core of all digital designs. The design and analysis of inverter enables the design of more complex structures, such as NAND, NOR and XOR gates. These complex structures in turn form the building blocks for modules, such as adders, multipliers and microprocessors. At 500 deg C and operating at a supply voltage of 1 V, the CJFET inverter have noise margin comparable to that of room temperature silicon and silicon on insulator CMOS inverters. Furthermore, the static power dissipation by CJFET inverter at 500 deg C is 20.6 nW which is six orders of magnitude lower than that by current SiC technologies, making CJFET technology ideal for achieving complex logic functions, far greater than a few-transistors ICs, in the nearer term.},

For the methane, sensor response was monitored at 0 ppm, then gas concentrations were measured between 2 and 200 ppm.  For both gases, exertions up to several 1000 pm were examined to mimic a leak.

  abstract = {This is a description of the design of a low-power, low-cost networked array of sensors for the remote monitoring of carbon dioxide and methane.  The goal was to create a scalable self-powered two-dimensional array for the detection of these gases in a large area.  The sensor selection, electronic design, and data communication was studied and optimized to allow for multiple units to form a self-assembling network for acre-scale coverage with minimal human intervention.  The final electronic design of the solar-powered units is flexible, providing a foundation for future field deployable remote monitoring devices.  Sensors were selected for this application from commercially available models based on low-power, low-cost, market availability, detection range, and accuracy around the global baseline criteria.  For environmental monitoring, carbon dioxide sensors are characterized near 400 ppm and methane from 2 to 200 ppm.  For both gases, exertions up to several 1000 pm were examined to mimic large releases.  An Xbee mesh network of radios was utilized to coordinate the individual units in the array, and the data was transferred in real-time over the cellular network to a dedicated server.  The system was tested at a site north of the Oklahoma State campus, an unmanned airfield east of Stillwater, OK, and an injection well near Farnsworth, TX.  Data collected from the Stillwater test sites show that the system is reliable for baseline gas levels.  The gas injection well site was monitored as a potential source of carbon dioxide and methane leaks due to the carbon dioxide injection process undertaken there for carbon sequestration and enhanced oil recovery efforts.  The sensors are shown to be effective at detecting gas concentration at the sites and few possible leak events are detected.},

The parasitic ringing caused by different parasitic effects is analyzed. Two different methods, the use of an RC snubber and the use of suppression ferrite component, are investigated for dampening the parasitic oscillations. It is found that applying a ferrite bead not only dampens the parasitic oscillations, but also results in significantly lower switching losses. Furthermore, it is shown that the capacitive coupling between SiC devices in the bridge leg and heat sinks significantly deteriorates the JFETs' switching performance. The effect of two substrates, an insulated metal substrate and a printed circuit board, on the capacitive coupling is investigated. A method in which the use of two separate heat spreaders minimizes the capacitive coupling, thus, exploiting the full potential of fast SiC JFETs is proposed.},

The widely accepted model for CMOS gate and interconnect line is used for the representation. The CMOS gate is modeled by an Alpha Power law model, whereas the distributed RLC interconnect is represented by an equivalent $\pi$-model. The output waveform and the propagation delay of the inverter are analytically calculated and compared with SPICE simulations. The analytical driver-interconnect load model gives sufficiently close results to SPICE simulations for two different cases of slow and fast input ramps. For each case of stimulation, the model gives an insight to four regions of operation of the CMOS gate. The voltage waveform at the end of an interconnect line is obtained for each region of operation. The SPICE and analytical results for the output voltage waveform and propagation delay match very closely.},

Its mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, ability to operate at high temperatures and extreme chemical inertness in several liquid electrolytes, make SiC an attractive candidate for MEMS applications, both as structural material and as coating layer. The recently reported progress in material growth and processing techniques has strengthened the potential of this material for MEMS, especially for applications requiring operation at high temperature or in severe environments. Examples of SiC microsensors and microstructures are given and interesting development in both material characteristics and micromachining processes are discussed.},

  abstract = {Wide band-gap semiconductors are most attractive as materials for power devices due to low losses, improved temperature capability and high thermal conductivity. Although silicon carbide Schottky diodes have been commercially available for years, an active wide band-gap switch has still been missing. In this work, the 1200 V SiC JFET is introduced as commercially available SiC power switch. The JFET offers an excellent performance while being a normally-on device. As an alternative to get a normally-off behavior, the direct-driven JFET concept is proposed which combines a normally-on JFET with a low-voltage normally-off silicon MOSFET. An intelligent driver solution is developed to benefit from the full JFET performance. Application tests indicate excellent performance of the proposed solution.},

All circuits function with high performance at temperatures from 25 $^\circ$C to 550 $^\circ$C. The core inverter has an outstanding dc characteristic transfer function with a steep slope, including a gain of $>$; -20 up to 500 $^\circ$C, and a logic threshold that is well centered in the logic swing. NOR and NAND gates were likewise tested in this temperature range, and dynamic characteristics are presented. This SiC technology provides a platform for applications demanding reliable digital circuits at temperatures higher than 300 $^\circ$C, well beyond the capability of silicon technology.},

Packaged SITs have produced 57 W of output power at 500 MHz, SiC UMOSFETs (1200 V) are projected to have 15 times the current density of Si IGBTs (1200 V). Submicron gate length 4H-SiC MESFETs have achieved fmax=32 GHz, fT=14.0 GHz, and power density=2.8 W/mm @ 1.8 GHz.
